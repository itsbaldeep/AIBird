# Bird.js
This is a flappy bird game, which is made in pure native javascript.

# Play this now [here](https://itsbaldeep.github.io/birdjs/)

It is made with object oriented programming.
The whole game is run on **HTML Canvas**, and sprites/shapes are drawn in that canvas.

The code is written in **ES6/7** Syntax with efficient coding.
In future, I would implement Machine Learning algorithms to make the bird play by itself.
